# phase-1-project-modrinth-search
Mock recreation of the modrinth search page made with pure JavaScript

## Pitch
This site has a really good api so I thought it would be fun to work with

## Project "User Stories"
1. I can as a User, click on a mod's name/icon to go to it's page
2. I can as a User, click on a mod's author to go to it's author's page
3. I can as a User select mod categories and see mods that fit into them
4. I can as a User, type a query into the search bar to narrow the mods that are shown, (updating after pressing enter)
5. I can as a User, click the next/previous page button to go to the next or previous page.
## Stretch goals
1. I can as a User hover over the mod's creation and modified date to see the exact date and time


## Project Requirements
1. Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. APIs that are free and require no authorization will be easiest to use. For ideas, see this list of no-auth APIs (Links to an external site.). If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to github!

2. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. Use at least 3 unique event-listeners (Links to an external site.) that enable interactivity. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should have its own unique callback function.

4. Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
